This folder holds the groundwater depth data measured in the field as well as the water quality data that is measured in the ISU water quality laboratory.  
  
The "corrections.csv" file is used in script to correct/standardize any of the site, treatment, or position names. The first row has the column names, which are:
  
  * bad (any bad names I have found in the data)  
  * good (the correct name that the **bad** data needs to be changed to)
